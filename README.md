# Snack-Viraly_React_Native
React Native code used to create some of the pages in the Viraly prototype - done in Expo Snack.

PLEASE READ BEFORE LOOKING AT THE CODE!!!!!!!!!!

This code was produced using Expo Snack. Most things should function as they appear in Expo Snack, but aspects like fonts and navigation will not be working properly 
as the libraries needed to make these elements work would not work in Expo Snack. I would recommend looking over the React Native website and the Expo Go website with 
React Native libraries to make these aspects functional.
The code from the other React Native code includes code that should get the font styles working properly, but you will need to go to Google Fonts and download the TTF files for 
the fonts listed and put them in the same file directory.
